What needs to be done is to resort to an eco-friendly way of living.

Every individual needs to reduce their own carbon footprint and consequently affect the environment in a positive way. If each one of us makes some efforts to reduce our personal waste and analyze the effects our actions have on the environment, then a change can easily be reached.
